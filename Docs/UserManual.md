Now, it's just a matter of what it will cost...

3. Installation Guide

Getting started with Mists of Thelema is quick and easy.
3.1 Downloading the Game

    Navigate to the official download page for Mists of Thelema on this website.

    Locate the download link for the game executable.

    Click the link to download the game package (e.g., a .zip file or direct .exe).

    If it's a .zip file, extract its contents to a folder of your choice on your computer (e.g., "C:\Games\MistsOfT").

    Once downloaded and extracted (if applicable), navigate to the folder where you saved the game files.

    Locate the executable file named MistsOfThelema.exe.

    Double-click MistsOfThelema.exe to launch the game.

4. Getting Started
4.1 First Launch

Upon launching the game, you will first see the TitleScreen. This screen features the game's logo, an introductory text, and interactive buttons.
4.2 Navigating the Title Screen

    Click the large "Start Game" button (or similar) to proceed to the story introduction.

    After the story introduction, press the "Go" button to enter the main gameplay area, "Scene 1."

5. Gameplay Mechanics
5.1 Controls

Mastering the controls is essential for navigating the mysterious city:

    W – Move your character Up.

    A – Move your character Left.

    S – Move your character Down.

    D – Move your character Right.

    E – Interact button: Use this key to talk to NPCs or pick up items.

    I – Inventory button: Press this key to open and view your character's inventory.

    Left Mouse Button (used occasionally): May be used for menu selections or specific interactions.

5.2 Exploring the City

In the main gameplay area (Scene 1), you will move your character around the city. The game features boundaries to prevent you from moving outside the playable area. Explore carefully to find NPCs and items.
5.3 Interacting with NPCs

NPCs (Non-Player Characters) are crucial for progressing in Mists of Thelema.

    To interact with an NPC, move your character close to them and press the E key.

    Engage in dialogues to gather information or acquire valuable items.

    Important Note: Each NPC will only engage in dialogue with you once per day. Choose your words and actions wisely, as your decisions can have significant consequences.

5.4 Inventory Management

Your inventory holds items that can help you survive or influence the outcome of events.

    Press the I key to open your inventory screen.

    Items you collect will appear here. Some items may be used automatically in certain scenarios, while others might require your decision.

5.5 The Day/Night Cycle and End-of-Day Scenarios

Time progresses in Mists of Thelema. Your day in the city will conclude in one of two ways:

    Timer Expiration: An automatically set timer will eventually run out, signaling the end of the day.

    Entering Your House: You can manually end the day by moving your character into the red house labeled "Your House" on the map.

Once the day concludes, you will transition to the EndOfDay scene. Here, a random event will occur. Your inventory and previous decisions might provide you with the means to solve the problem, leading to your survival, or you might succumb to a tragic event. Sometimes, nothing significant may happen at all.
5.6 Decisions and Consequences

Your choices and actions throughout the day are paramount. The items you collect, the NPCs you speak to, and the decisions you make will directly influence the random event at the end of the day and ultimately determine whether you survive or perish.

After the outcome of the end-of-day scenario is announced (whether you survived and under what circumstances, or if you perished), the game currently concludes.
6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while playing Mists of Thelema, please follow these steps:

    Review Instructions: Ensure you have carefully read all instructions in this manual. You might have overlooked a crucial piece of information.

    Restart the Game: If the game seems to be behaving unexpectedly or not functioning correctly, try closing the application completely and reopening it.

    Contact Support: If the problem persists after restarting, please contact the developer for support on this website. Provide as much detail as possible about the issue, including when it occurred and any error messages.

7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

    Q: The game isn't launching. What should I do?

        A: Ensure your system meets the System Requirements and that you have extracted all files from the downloaded package (if it was a .zip). Try running the MistsOfThelema.exe file as an administrator (right-click -> Run as administrator).

    Q: Why does the game end so quickly?

        A: Currently, Mists of Thelema is a demo version featuring one playable day. The game concludes after the end-of-day scenario. Please refer to the Current Version Extensions section for information on planned updates.

    Q: Can I save my game progress?

        A: In this demo version, there is no save functionality. Each playthrough is a fresh start. Saving is a planned feature for future versions.

    Q: I can't interact with an NPC more than once. Is this a bug?

        A: No, this is an intended game mechanic. Each NPC will only talk to you once per day. This emphasizes the importance of your choices.
